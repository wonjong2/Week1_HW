# <Week1_HW : Code Refactoring>

## Description

To make this web site rank higher in search engines and let the people with disabilities can access easier to it, I did refactoring old code to meet the web accessibility standard without any changes in current look of the web site.

- Replaces 'div' tags with proper semantic tags like 'header', 'nav', 'footer', 'section' and 'aside' tags in both html and CSS files
- Adds 'alt' atttibute into img elements
- Changes title of this web site
- Adds 'id' attribute into 'section' element to jump to 'Search Engine Optimization' content when user clicks 'Search Engine Optimization' item in top menu
